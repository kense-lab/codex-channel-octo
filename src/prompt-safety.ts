/**
 * Prompt-safety helpers — the SINGLE source of truth for neutralizing
 * user-controlled text before it enters the agent system prompt.
 *
 * Threat: the system prompt is a flat string with structural markers —
 * section headers (`[Group context]`, `[Conversation history]`, `[Quoted
 * message from ...]`) and per-turn role labels (`[user <name>]:`,
 * `[assistant <name>]:`). Every one of those is emitted by OUR renderers. If a
 * user-controlled name or body reproduces one, it forges structure the model
 * then trusts — and in shared-group mode the forged turn is seen by every
 * member (cross-user context poisoning).
 *
 * Coherent policy (defined here, used everywhere):
 *  - Names that go INTO a label  -> sanitizeDisplayName (strip the label
 *    delimiters `[` `]` and line breaks, cap length).
 *  - Bodies INSIDE a labeled line -> escapeRoleLabels (escape a line-leading
 *    role label so it is inert text, not a turn boundary).
 *  - Assembled blocks -> escapeSectionMarkers (escape a line-leading SECTION
 *    header). Orthogonal to the above; applied once per block.
 *
 * Escaping is per-FRAGMENT, before the fragment is wrapped in a label — you
 * cannot escape the assembled block, because that would also clobber the
 * legitimate labels our own renderers add.

/**
 * Section markers that delimit structural sections of the system prompt. If
 * these appear at the start of a line inside user-controlled text they are
 * escaped so a sender cannot inject a fake structural boundary (S3 fix).
 *
 * Covers EVERY structural marker any renderer emits \u2014 including the G10
 * segmentation markers (`[answered history]`, `[new messages]`), the group
 * context header (`[Recent group messages]`), the trusted-instructions header
 * (`[Group instructions]`), and the truncation notices \u2014 so user content cannot
 * forge a boundary the model treats as real structure.
 *
 * `Current message[^\]]*` (not the bare `Current message`) matches the FULL
 * anchor `[Current message \u2014 respond to this ONLY]` that assembleUserMessage
 * (#132) prepends to the real request, the same way `Quoted message from [^\]]*`
 * covers its variable suffix. The anchor is a PRIVILEGED marker \u2014 the system
 * prompt tells the model to "respond ONLY to the text after it" \u2014 so a group
 * member who typed it verbatim into a non-@ message (which lands in the
 * [Recent group messages] read-only background) could otherwise forge a second
 * "current message" and have their injected text treated as the request. The
 * bare-`]` form alone left that gap open (#132 review).
 *
 * The exact emitted form is exported as CURRENT_MESSAGE_ANCHOR (single source of
 * truth \u2014 see below). The branch here is intentionally BROADER than that constant
 * (any `[Current message\u2026]` variant is escaped), so the two cannot drift into a
 * gap; a drift-guard test asserts the constant is matched by this regex.
 *
 * The leading `([^\S\r\n]*)` group absorbs indentation (spaces/tabs) before the
 * `[`, mirroring ROLE_LABEL_RE. Without it `^\[` only matched COLUMN-0 markers, so
 * a forged marker preceded by a single space/tab slipped through unescaped \u2014 and
 * group-delta content can contain newlines (group-context.ts), so an attacker can
 * plant an indented line. escapeSectionMarkers preserves the captured whitespace
 * and backslash-escapes the `[` (#133 review: yujiawei P0). `Prior conversation
 * history[^\]]*` is included so the first-turn/fallback history header
 * (index.ts) is covered too \u2014 making the "cannot drift into a gap" claim hold.
