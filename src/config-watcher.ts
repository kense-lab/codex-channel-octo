/**
 * Config watcher — drives BotManager from config.json changes (#157).
 *
 * Watches the global config's directory (not the file directly: an atomic
 * temp+rename swaps the inode, and a file-targeted fs.watch would stop firing
 * after the first rename). On any change it schedules a debounced, serialized
 * `applyLatestConfig`, which RE-READS the latest config inside the task (never
 * a precomputed diff — plan C6) and reconciles the running set toward it.
 *
 * Robustness (plan D): the desired set is produced by a single `loadDesired`
 * call; if it throws for ANY reason (half-written file, JSON error, missing
 * token, duplicate id, unsafe apiUrl, broken per-bot config), the current
 * running set is left untouched — a bad edit never tears down healthy bots.

 * BotManager queue keeps the set consistent. Pure-ish (no fs) for unit testing.
 *
 * `isStale` is checked before each add/remove: a newer config event makes the
 * in-flight reconcile abandon its remaining (now outdated) actions, so a bot
 * removed by a later edit is never started by an earlier, slower reconcile
