/**
 * In-chat slash commands (v0.3).
 *
 * Users can control their session without leaving the chat:
 *   /reset            — clear this session's conversation history
 *   /config           — show the effective per-session settings
 *   /help             — list available commands
 *
 * Commands are matched on the FIRST line of the cleaned message text (after the
 * router has stripped any leading @bot mention), so `@bot /reset` works in
 * groups. Matching is case-insensitive and tolerant of surrounding whitespace.
 *
 * A command is scoped to the sessionKey of the message. In a group the session
 * is shared per channel, so `/reset` clears the WHOLE group's conversation
 * history (every member shares one session), not just the caller's. In a DM it
 * clears that peer's history. Note: it does NOT clear long-term auto-memory.
 *
 * Note: commands are handled inside the router's processing callback, AFTER the
 * per-session rate limit is applied. A user who has exhausted their token bucket
 * therefore cannot run `/reset` or `/help` until it refills — control commands
 * are rate-limited like normal messages. This is intentional (a flooder should
 * not get a rate-limit bypass via slash commands); documented in the README.
