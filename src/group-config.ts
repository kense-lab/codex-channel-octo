/**
 * v1.0: GROUP.md / THREAD.md per-conversation instruction files.
 *
 * Operators can drop a markdown file with custom instructions for a specific
 * group (or, later, thread) into a configured directory. Its contents are
 * injected into the agent's system prompt as a trusted instruction block, so a
 * group can have its own persona / rules without code changes.
 *
 * SECURITY — read carefully. The `[Group instructions]` block is injected into
 * the system prompt UNSANITIZED, so its contents are trusted. That trust holds
 * ONLY if the file is writable solely by the operator (the gateway process user).
 *
 * Placing `groupConfigDir` outside `cwdBase` is necessary but NOT sufficient:
 * under the shipped defaults (`allowedTools: '*'`, `bypassPermissions`) the agent
 * has `Bash`/`Write` and can write ABSOLUTE paths anywhere the gateway user can
 * write — `cwdBase` is a starting dir, not a chroot. So a malicious user in one
 * group could drive the agent to write `<groupConfigDir>/<otherGroup>.md` and
 * inject persistent, trusted instructions into a different group.
 *
 * The real protection is OS-level: `groupConfigDir` and its files MUST be made
 * non-writable by the gateway process user (e.g. root-owned, mode 0755/0644),
 * and/or the deployment hardened (drop `Bash`, sandboxed FS, unprivileged user).
 * As cheap defense-in-depth, loadGroupConfig() refuses to inject a file that is
 * group- or world-writable. The group id is filename-pinned to a safe slug so a
 * crafted id can't traverse out of the config dir.
